## Goal of this Ethical Analysis 
---
Throughout the semester, we were tasked with completing a holistic analysis of the Boeing 737 Max incident. This case study examines the intersection of aggressive corporate competition, the failure of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), and the erosion of regulatory oversight that led to the loss of 346 lives


## Context of the Boeing 737 Max Incident 
---
A holistic analysis requires looking at the incident through three distinct lenses: technical behavior, individual actions, and organizational culture. I will explore the material, technical, individual, and organizational facts in this section.

The **technical root** of the crisis was the **MCAS design**, which introduced a "single point of failure" by depending on a single Angle of Attack (AoA) sensor. This lack of redundancy meant that a simple sensor malfunction could trigger repeated, uncommanded nose-down inputs. Furthermore, critical safety alerts—such as the "AoA Disagree" light—were treated as optional, leaving many pilots unaware of the error conditions. These facts are ethically significant because they represent a departure from redundant safety standards, directly compromising the welfare of the public for the sake of simplified certification.

At the **individual level**, internal warnings were raised early. Engineers voiced concerns regarding the single-sensor risk and the lack of redundancy, yet these concerns were minimized to protect production timelines. Test pilot warnings also existed but did not trigger the necessary deep-level design reviews. These decisions show a breakdown in professional responsibility where individual expertise was overridden by schedule pressure.

The c**orporate culture** at Boeing favored speed-to-market to compete with the Airbus A320neo. This led to a "no extra training" incentive policy where Boeing prioritized cost-savings for airlines over operational preparedness. Furthermore, the FAA's delegation of oversight to Boeing employees blurred the boundaries between the regulator and the manufacturer, creating a culture of "regulatory capture."


This is how I solved the problem:

```python
    some code = 10;
    plot();
```
