## Goal of this Ethical Analysis 
---
Throughout the semester, we were tasked with completing a holistic analysis of the Boeing 737 Max incident. This case study serves as a critical investigation into the intersection of aggressive corporate competition and the compromise of engineering integrity. Specifically, we examine the implementation of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) and the decision-making processes at Boeing and the FAA that prioritized market speed over the fundamental duty of public safety. By utilizing the ASME Code of Ethics, this essay analyzes the breakdown of professional responsibility that led to the deaths of 346 people and seeks to propose systemic reforms to prevent the "normalization of deviance" in future high-stakes engineering projects.

## Relevant Facts and Technical Discussion
---

### Material and Technical Facts
The technical failure of the 737 MAX was not an isolated software glitch, but a deliberate design choice that created a "single point of failure" vulnerability. To accommodate larger, more fuel-efficient engines, Boeing altered the aerodynamics of the 737 airframe, necessitating the MCAS software to prevent stalls. However, the system was designed to rely on a single Angle of Attack (AoA) sensor. This meant that if that one sensor failed or provided an erroneous "high" reading, the software would repeatedly force the aircraft's nose down, regardless of pilot input.

Furthermore, Boeing treated critical safety alerts, such as the "AoA Disagree" light, as optional equipment. This lack of transparency meant that flight crews were often flying aircraft with disabled safety indicators, unaware of sensor discrepancies until they reached a point of catastrophic failure. The omission of MCAS from pilot manuals—a choice made to keep training costs low—stripped pilots of the knowledge required to manually override the system in an emergency.



### Individual and Organizational Facts
The organizational culture at Boeing underwent a shift that prioritized "speed-to-market" over conservative safety margins. Internal documents reveal that engineers expressed concerns regarding the system's high authority over flight surfaces, yet these warnings were minimized to prevent delays in the competition with the Airbus A320neo. 

This culture was exacerbated by the FAA’s "delegated authority" model, where the regulator effectively allowed Boeing to oversee its own safety certification. This removed the independent "probing" that is essential to public safety. The eventual post-crash response, including the firing of the CEO and the worldwide grounding of the fleet, illustrated a late-stage realization that the company’s reputation and the public’s trust had been fundamentally broken by prioritizing profit-driven training protocols over operational reliability.

## Definitional Clarification: The Stakeholder Perspective
---
Ethical judgments in this case are heavily influenced by how different stakeholders define key concepts. The conflict of these definitions highlights why the disaster occurred:

* **Safety:** Boeing’s internal metric for safety was often reduced to **Regulatory Compliance**. If a design met the minimum federal standards, it was deemed "safe." In contrast, the families of the victims and the engineering community define safety as **Risk Prevention**—the active elimination of foreseeable catastrophic failure points, regardless of whether a regulation specifically forbids them.
* **Trust:** To the corporation, trust was a **legal obligation** to be met through contracts and federal filings. For the public and flight crews, trust is a **moral contract**; it is the expectation that a manufacturer has done everything within their technological power to ensure a safe return, even if it reduces profit margins.
* **Accountability:** Boeing’s leadership viewed accountability as **cooperating with investigations** and structural reorganization. However, true ethical accountability requires **public acknowledgment of wrongdoing** and a transparent disclosure of why safety warnings were ignored.

**Bridge Statement:** These definitional differences explain why Boeing could argue they were "technically compliant" while the world saw a systemic failure of morality. If safety is merely a checklist, the MAX was legal; if safety is the protection of life, the MAX was a failure of the profession.

## Ethical Analysis of Core Issues
---
Using the ASME Code of Ethics, we analyze the five primary conflicts that defined the MAX development:

### 1. The Implementation of MCAS without Redundancy
* **Stakeholders:** Passengers, pilots, and Boeing engineers.
* **Relevant Canons:** Canon 1 (Public Safety).
* **Conflict:** The pressure to innovate quickly vs. the requirement for redundant, fail-safe systems.
* **Hierarchy:** Canon 1 is paramount. No innovation is "successful" if it introduces a single point of failure in a life-critical system.
* **Resolution:** Prioritizing market speed over redundant sensor architecture is a direct violation of the engineer's duty to public welfare.

### 2. The Omission of Pilot Training
* **Stakeholders:** Flight crews and airline customers.
* **Relevant Canons:** Canon 2 (Professional Competence).
* **Conflict:** Reducing airline costs to win contracts vs. ensuring pilots are competent to handle new automated tools.
* **Hierarchy:** Canon 1 (Safety) requires Canon 2 (Competence). A pilot cannot be competent if the system behavior is hidden from them.
* **Resolution:** Pilot training must be a non-negotiable federal requirement, not a variable cost to be minimized by the manufacturer.

### 3. Automation vs. Manual Control
* **Stakeholders:** Pilots and flight software engineers.
* **Relevant Canons:** Canon 1.
* **Conflict:** Substituting manual piloting with "black box" automated tools to simplify operation.
* **Hierarchy:** Technology should assist human judgment, not override it without a clear, manual bypass.
* **Resolution:** Designing software that can override a pilot's manual input without their knowledge is ethically unacceptable.

### 4. The Decision Not to Ground After the First Crash
* **Stakeholders:** The global flying public.
* **Relevant Canons:** Canon 1.
* **Conflict:** The massive monetary cost of grounding a fleet vs. the statistical probability of a second failure.
* **Hierarchy:** The duty to protect life must always take precedence over monetary loss or corporate reputation.
* **Resolution:** Failing to ground the aircraft after the Lion Air crash was a breach of the paramount duty to protect the public.

### 5. Transparency in Public Communication
* **Stakeholders:** Passengers and regulators.
* **Relevant Canons:** Canon 7 (Truthful Statements).
* **Conflict:** Withholding technical risks to protect "company image" vs. the requirement to be objective and truthful.
* **Hierarchy:** Canon 7 is the backbone of public trust.
* **Resolution:** Concealing the risks of MCAS from the public and regulators constitutes a deceptive act that undermines the integrity of the profession.

## Preventing Repeat Failures: A Multi-Level Strategy
---
To prevent the recurrence of such a tragedy, we must address the "normalization of deviance" at every level of the engineering ecosystem:

### Individual Level
Engineers must move beyond being "faithful agents" of their employers and reclaim their identity as "protectors of the public." This requires specialized ethics training that focuses on the **Moral Courage** to dissent. Engineers must be empowered to document safety concerns with rigor, ensuring that technical objections are not "scrubbed" from official reports as they move up the chain of command.

### Organizational Level
Boeing, and companies like it, must reform their internal safety culture. This involves creating **Independent Safety Review Boards** that report directly to the Board of Directors, bypassing project managers who are incentivized by schedule and cost. There must be a move away from "Jedi mind tricks" in regulatory communication toward **Radical Transparency**, where the default is to share safety-critical data rather than hide it.

### Systemic Level
The FAA must end the practice of "unsupervised delegation." While manufacturers provide expertise, the regulator must provide **Independent Probing**. This includes mandatory third-party validation for any software capable of moving flight surfaces and standardized, industry-wide regulations that prevent companies from treating pilot training as a "negotiable" cost.

## Conclusion
---
The 737 MAX crisis serves as a grim reminder that engineering is not merely a technical discipline, but a moral one. The disaster was not caused by a lack of engineering talent, but by a lack of engineering integrity at the leadership level. When a corporation defines its success by its stock price and delivery schedule rather than the safety of the human beings it carries, a catastrophic failure becomes inevitable.

True accountability for the 737 MAX incident requires more than just a software patch or a change in leadership; it requires a fundamental shift in the social contract between the engineer and the public. We must re-establish the principle that an engineer’s paramount duty is to the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Only by empowering dissent, mandating transparency, and ensuring independent oversight can we hope to restore the trust that was lost in the skies over Indonesia and Ethiopia.
